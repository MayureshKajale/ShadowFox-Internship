# Create a variable called for and assign it a value 4. See what happens and find out the reason behind the behaviour that you see.

for=4
print(for)

"""
The reason behind the behaviour of the program is :
    'for' is the reserved in keyword in python and we can't create a variable of the same name as reserved keyword here the variable named is 'for' which is not possible. python will find it as syntax error
